Besides my research experience, I have gained significant teaching experience. As an undergraduate teaching assistant of Operating Systems class, I have held weekly office hours and
explained Operating Systems concepts in the recitations. This teaching experience made me realize
that not only do I love to teach, but I also have the desire and skills to explain concepts with theoretical
intensity in a pedagogical way, starting from the basic building blocks of the topic and supporting them with analogies from everyday life.
