Hello! My name is Nureddin, and I am a senior Computer science and Engineering student at Sabanci University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Erkay Savas and Prof. Cemal Yilmaz.

My main research interests lie on the intersection of operating systems, computer architecture and security. I am impressed by the interaction between the hardware and the software. I feel intellectually fulfilled while working on system and security topics. In general, I love building secure and reliable systems and I believe research in this direction has a major potential positive impact on the society. More recently, I am working on developing a static analysis tool to detect timing based side channel attacks.

When I am not working on projects, I enjoy playing Dota2 (best offlaner in the universe), reading history, and going on a hike or road trip. I love to read about social, economical and political history and observe the change of human mentality throughout history as a result of changes in socio-economic and/or political situation. I also love physics and astronomy.
